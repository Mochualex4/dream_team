This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) employee management web app using Flask, a microframework for Python. I've named the app Dream Team, and it will have the following features:

Users will be able to register and login as employees
1. The administrator will be able to create, update, and delete departments and roles
2. The administrator will be able to assign employees to a department and assign them roles
3. The administrator will be able to view all employees and their details
